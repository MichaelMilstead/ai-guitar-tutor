# AI Guitar Tutor

An agentic app built using [Tambo](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo) to allow an AI to control a guitar tabs component.

Some ideas to try:

"I want to make a simple song, help me think of some chords"

"How do I play that 'indie pop' style?"

"Based on the chords I know, what should I learn next?"

## Running

Get a Tambo api key for free:
`npx tambo@latest init`

Install dependencies and run:

`npm i`

`npm run dev`

## Future

Add a "guided learning" mode, where rather than asking for specific information, the AI will guide you through lessons, duolingo-style.
